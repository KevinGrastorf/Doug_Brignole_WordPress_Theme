<div class="what-is-about">
  <p>“Biomechanics” is the study of <strong>human anatomy</strong> (the musculoskeletal system and the neurology that applies to it) and <strong>physics</strong> - combined.</p>
  <p>Any exercise that involves “resistance”—whether from free weights, cables, machines, elastic bands, body weight, etc.—involves physics, which dictates specific principles resulting in magnification of force.</p>
  <p>All anatomical movements can be evaluated by understanding the anatomy—according to what constitutes “natural” and “efficient” joint /muscle motion, and also how the Central Nervous System responds to various motions. Some motions are very safe, while others are not so safe—even dangerous.  Some motions are more productive, while others are less productive—even useless.</p>

Some motions are very safe, while others are not so safe—even dangerous.  Some motions are more productive, while others are less productive—even useless.</p>
  <p>Anyone who is in the business of “teaching” resistance exercise, SHOULD understand biomechanics as it relates to resistance exercise. Biomechanics knowledge allows a person to select “better” exercises (more efficient, more productive and more safe), and avoid exercises that are inefficient, compromised in their degree of productivity, and potential injurious.</p>
  <p>Doug Brignole is also the author of “The Physics of Fitness”, which is endorsed by ten scholars (Ph.D. professors) and three orthopedic surgeons.  He is the leading authority on the topic of “resistance exercise, as applied to resistance exercise”.  He has over 40 years experience in the field, and numerous bodybuilding championships to his name.</p>
  <p><strong>Brignole Biomechanics</strong> is the official Trainer Certification program, which teaches the principles that allows a trainer to optimize exercise results, and minimize exercise injury risk.  This curriculum is offered internationally, in multiple languages, with the goal of standardizing the principles which lead to the best fitness results, the least amount of wasted effort, and in the safest possible manner.</p>
  <p>As one example of how an exercise can be evaluated for biomechanical efficiency, consider the following.  </p>
  <p>The amount of resistance (load) placed upon a person’s triceps (a person who weighs 180 pounds), during “Parallel Bar Dips”, is approximately 119 pounds per arm.  Conversely, the amount of resistance (load) placed upon a person’s triceps, during “Supine (flat bench) Dumbbell Triceps Extensions”—using only 20 pounds in each hand (40 pounds total) is approximately 240 pounds.  This is due to the angle of the forearm during each of these two exercises.</p>
  <p>Needless to say, it’s foolish to put out more effort and get less benefit, when a “better” option is available, which provides more benefit with less effort.</p>
  <p>The following factors determine the efficiency, productivity and safety of a resistance exercise.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The angle of a target muscle’s “operating lever” (limb), relative to a given direction of resistance</li>
  <li>The angle at which a muscle pulls on its corresponding limb, depending on the degree of bend at the joint
</li>
  <li>The length of an “operating lever” (limb or combined limbs)
</li>
  <li>The “resistance curve”—the sequential variations of resistance, as a limb travels through an arc / range of motion
</li>
  <li>Where a limb is positioned—during an exercise—relative to the “base” or the “apex”</li>
  <li>Whether or not an exercise has “alignment”—i.e., is on the same plane as the direction of motion, and the direction of resistance, and the origin / insertion of the target muscle</li>
  <li>Whether or not the direction of resistance comes from a position that is directly opposite the origin of a target muscle</li>
  <li>Whether a joint is being moved the way it is designed to move, or it is being moved in an unnatural direction or manner</li>
  <li>Whether or not a limb is being moved directly toward a target muscle’s origin
</li>
  <li>Whether an exercise is being performed with full range of motion, partial range of motion, or no range of motion
</li>
  <li>Whether or not “bi-lateral” deficit is being avoided
</li>
  <li>Whether or not “reciprocal innervation” is being avoided</li>
  <li>Whether or not “active insuffiency” and “passive insuffiency” are being avoided</li>
  <li>Whether or not a weaker, non-target muscle interferes with (fatigues first) the adequate loading of the stronger target muscle</li>
  <li>Whether or not an exercise is being performed in a stable environment</li>
</ol>
<p>If a trainer does not thoroughly understand these factors, he (or she) is not sufficiently well-informed to “teach” resistance exercise, in the safest, most efficient and most productive manner.</p>


<p><strong>Brignole Biomechanics</strong> teaches these biomechanical principles to trainers—and provides trainers with <strong>certification</strong>—thereby ensuring that the clients who receive “resistance exercise” instruction from those trainers are optimally “trained” for the best results, the least wasted effort, and the least risk of injury.</p>
  <p>Before you hire a trainer, ask him (or her) if they are <strong>Brignole Biomechanics</strong> certified.  If that trainer suggests to you that they “don’t need that that certification”, ask them if they understand any of the concepts mentioned above.  If they don’t understand all of them (or worse—if they don’t understand ANY of them), you will not be receiving optimum resistance training instruction.
</p>
<p>You will be working much harder than you need to; you will be getting much less benefit than you could be getting; and you will experience a much greater risk of injury than is acceptable—if your trainer is not Brignole Biomechanics certified.</p>

  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>As a Personal Trainer and Tennis Coach for over 20 years, I have had the opportunity to work all around the globe, including Dubai, North Africa, USA and Canada. Over the years, I have enjoyed working with a range of clientele whom had all different goals and backgrounds, which required an understanding of the different cultures and mentalities.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>All though my clients had different background, lifestyle, genetics - everyone wanted the same thing, to be healthy, look good and learn how to workout to get the best results with minimum injury risk.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>As a Personal Trainer,  I have always measured my success based on how well my clients have reached their goals.  I pride myself on always being creative and constantly continuing my education in the fitness field as I am very passionate about this topic and always want to be able to support my clients with the most up to date info.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>Since this role requires me to always learn and update my knowledge, meeting Doug Brignole was a game changer.  His book, The Physics Of Fitness has an amazing amount of work put in it and the content is all explained in the most comprehensive way.  I wish I had access to this information when I first started in this field. This would have had a drastic impact on my method of training and exercise selection and made me and my clients that much more successful.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>Any person involved in this field should know these principles, it will enhance their knowledge and confidence as there will be no doubt or hesitation when deciding which exercise to use or when they are in a situation where they are required to provide an explanation. The details in this book/course are clear and detailed and this will support any trainer to be able to explain the benefits and avoidance of risks, for any exercise covered. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-coordinator">
    <p>Today the knowledge is available for everyone who shares the same passion and wants to be successful with their clients and their own goals.</p>
