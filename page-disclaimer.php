  <h2>PERSONAL DISCLAIMERS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are not medical professionals.  The information I provide is based on the personal experiences and studies of Doug Brignole and my experience as a Personal Trainer.</li>
    <li>The information contained in our website, blog, guest blogs, e-mails, programs, services and/or products is for educational and informational purposes only, and is made available to you as self-help tool for your own use. While we draw on our prior professional expertise and background in many areas, you acknowledge that we are supporting you in our roles exclusively as trainers and coaches only. We provide information concerning, but not limited to, biomechanics.</li>
    <li>We are not medical health practitioners or mental health providers and we are not holding ourselves out to be in any capacity. Rather, we serve as coaches, mentors, and guides who help you and your clients reach their own health and wellness goals.</li>
    <li>We aim to accurately represent the information provided on this website, blog, e-mails, programs, services, and products. You are acknowledging that you are participating voluntarily in using our website or blog or in any of our e-mails, programs, services, and/or products, and you alone are solely and personally responsible for your results.

</li>
<li>In the event that you use the information provided through our website, blog, e-mails, programs, services, and/or products, we assume no responsibility.</li>
<li>Every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of published information on or through our website, blog, e-mails, programs, services and products; however, the information may inadvertently contain inaccuracies or typographical errors. Every effort has been made to present you with the most accurate, up-to-date information, but because the nature of biomechanic research is constantly evolving, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of our content.
</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>RESULTS DISCLAIMERS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We make every effort to ensure that we accurately represent these products and services and their potential for results. There is no guarantee that you will experience the same results and you accept the risk that the muscle building results, fitness results, competition results and fat loss results differ by individual. </li>
    <li>We make no guarantees concerning the level of success you may experience, and you accept the risk that results will differ for each individual. The testimonials and examples provided are exceptional results, which do not apply to the average purchaser, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results.</li>
    <li>Each individual’s health, fitness, and nutrition success depends on his or her background, dedication, desire, and motivation. As with any health-related program or service, your results may vary, and will be based on many variables, including but not limited to, your individual capacity, life experience, unique health and genetic profile, starting point, expertise, and level of commitment.</li>
    <li>There is no assurance that examples of past fitness, competition, muscle building and/or fat burning results can be duplicated in the future. We cannot guarantee your future results and/or success.  Nor can we guarantee that you maintain the results you experience if you do not continue following the program. We are not responsible for your actions. </li>
    <li>The use of our information, products and services should be based on your own due diligence and you agree that our company is not liable for any success or failure of your physique that is directly or indirectly related to the purchase and use of our information, products and services.
</li>
<li>We present real world experiences and insights on other people’s experiences for purposes of illustration only.</li>
<li>The testimonials, examples, and photos used are of actual clients and results they personally achieved. Each client has approved these testimonials, examples, and photos for use in materials to speak to our program, service, and/or product capabilities, but they are not intended to represent or guarantee that current or future clients will achieve the same or similar results. Rather, these client stories represent what is possible with our programs, services, and/or products.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What Else?</h2>
  <p>You may also want to use the requirement to read and acknowledge disclaimers as another way of ensuring your business is reaching its ideal client.
For example, </p>
<ul>
  <li>If this disclaimer causes you any concern whatsoever or dissuades you from taking action, then my information, products, and services are not for you.  However, if this disclaimer inspired you to “step up to the plate” and make an honest effort at working with us and the solutions we offer – congratulations! We look forward to working with you.</li>
